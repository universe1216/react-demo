# üîñ Todo With React
A simple todo app built with Appwrite and React

If you simply want to try out the App, go ahead and check out the demo at https://react-todo-mvc.vercel.app/

## üé¨ Getting Started

### ü§ò Install Appwrite 
Follow our simple [Installation Guide](https://appwrite.io/docs/installation) to get Appwrite up and running in no time. You can either deploy Appwrite on your local machine or, on any cloud provider of your choice. 

> Note: If you setup Appwrite on your local machine, you will need to create a public IP so that your hosted frontend can access it.
  
We need to make a few configuration changes to your Appwrite server. 

1. Add a new Web App in Appwrite and enter the endpoint of your website (`localhost, <project-name>.vercel.app etc`)

2. Create a new collection with the following properties
